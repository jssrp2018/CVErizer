# CVErizer
Replication Package for the paper entitled "Summarizing Vulnerabilities' Descriptions for Minimizing Exposure Times"

DESCRIPTION OF THE CONTENT of folder "CVErizer_replication_package":
1. "RQ1" contains:
  
		a) "train.arff"  which contains the training set
		b) "test.arff" which contains the testing set
		c) "RQ1_results.xlsx" containing the results of classification achieved by some machine learning algorithms and association rules. Due to non-disclosure-agreement with our industrial partner, we are unauthorized to share raw data concerning RQ1.
		
    
2. "RQ2" contains:
  
    a) the folder "RQ2 raw data" comprising:
	
        I) the folder "GROUP_1" 
        II) the folder "GROUP_2"
        each of these folders contains the folders:
		
          1) TASK A
          2) TASK B
          3) TASK C
          In each of these folders take place the documents produced by the participants during the various steps of the experiment.
	
    b) "RQ2_aggregated_results.xlsx" which collects extracted/validated data and feedbacks received by experiment participants.
		

 3. "CVErizer" folder contains: 

    a) "CVErizer.jar", which contains the class files of a prototypical implementation of CVErizer  
    b) "README.txt" which contains some informations about the CVErizer tool  
    c) "lib" folder, which contains all the java libraries needed for running CVErizer   
    d) "CVErizer.sh" to automatize the execution of the tool under UNIX systems
